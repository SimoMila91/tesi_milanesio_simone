# AI-deck examples repository

> ⚠️ Important Notice: The GreenWaves Technologies website is down, preventing fetching and compiling the autotiler. This means that deploying neural networks through [gap_sdk](https://github.com/GreenWaves-Technologies/gap_sdk) or our Docker image is not possible unless you already have the file. However, you can still deploy neural networks using [DORY](https://github.com/pulp-platform/dory) as an alternative.
